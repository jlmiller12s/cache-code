# How to Create a Matrix-Style Background Video

Since I'm unable to directly generate a video file, here are a few options to create a matrix-style background video for your website:

## Option 1: Use an Existing Stock Video

1. Visit a stock video site like Pexels, Pixabay, or other free stock footage sites
2. Search for "matrix background", "digital rain", "binary code", or "tech background"
3. Download an appropriate free video
4. Rename it to `matrix-background.mp4` and place it in `cache-code/public/videos/`

## Option 2: Find a Matrix-Style Background on YouTube

1. Find an appropriate Matrix-style video on YouTube
2. Use a YouTube downloader (at your own risk and only for content you have permission to use)
3. Convert to MP4 if needed
4. Place in your project as `cache-code/public/videos/matrix-background.mp4`

## Option 3: Create Your Own With After Effects

Here's a simple process to create one in After Effects:

1. Create a new composition (1920x1080, 30fps, 30 seconds)
2. Create a solid black background
3. Use the Text tool to create columns of "0" and "1" characters in bright green (#15ff15)
4. Use expressions to animate them falling downward
5. Add glow and other effects
6. Export as MP4
7. Place in your project

## Option 4: Use an Online Placeholder Until You Have a Video

While building your site, you can use an online placeholder video service:

```html
<source src="https://placehold.co/matrix-video/mp4" type="video/mp4">
```

## Important Notes:

1. Make sure the video file is optimized for web (under 5MB if possible)
2. Consider using a compressed format for better performance
3. Always include fallback content inside the video tag
4. Implement correct preload behavior for better performance

Once you have your video in place, the website will display it as the background for your hero section, similar to MKBHD's website.
